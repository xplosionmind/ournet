title: Invite Tommi ðŸš€
description: The creator of <cite>Knitting Our Internet</cite>, [Tommi](https://tommi.space/ 'The virtual representation of Tommiâ€™s mind'), is the person who hosted it the most, so far. He absolutely looooooves to travel around and engage people of every age in many different contexts and events!

If you want to invite him to host the workshop, do not hesitate to [write him an email](mailto:lost.in@tommi.space)! Some general guidelines below.

## ðŸš… Travel expenses

Tommi is a student, and he cannot afford to travel around self-funded. Whenever he is invited, the only thing he asks is for his travel expenses to be **fully reimbursed**.

He prefers not to travel by airplane.

## ðŸª™ Retribution

Even though preparing every activity requires quite some time and a bit of expenses, Tommi usually hosts the worshop **for free**. Still, it would be immensely meaningful for him if his work could be valued with some sort of retribution, especially if the hosting entity is a for-profit.

Details to be discussed via email, and evaluated case-by-case.
