<h2>🧐 Über</h2>

<h3>Die Geschichte</h3>

<p>During the first semester of 2023, while writing <a href="https://tommi.space/csss/" title="“Computer Sciences Are Social Sciences”, Tommaso Marmo’s bachelor’s thesis">my bachelor’s thesis</a>, <a href="https://tommi.space/" title="The virtual representation of Tommi’s mind">I</a> got an idea for a simple yet critical and accurate introduction the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse" title="Fediverse on Wikipedia">Fediverse</a> to non-experts. That was the first spark from which this workshop was born, enriched by further research and experiences.</p>

<p>In June 2024, after <a href="/#events" title="Past and future occasions when this workshop was and will be hosted">having hosted the workshop in many occasions</a> I decided to deepen my work on <cite>Knitting Our Internet</cite>, also involving <a href="#contributors">some friends</a> to give it a visual identity, a better structure, and publish its website—the one you are reading right now.</p>

<h3>🫱🏼‍🫲🏾 For all! 💕</h3>

<p>It is not merely rhethorical: this workshop is truly <strong>for everyone</strong>! This workshop was <a href="/knit/#modularity">concieved to adapt</a> to any public and environment, by design.</p>

<ul>
	<li>It is <strong>inter-disciplinary</strong>, because it highlights the profoundly socio-political nature of something that is usually considered from a merely technical point of view. Furthermore, the workshop is meant to be contaminated by different forms of art and approaches.</li>
	<li>It is <strong>inter-generational</strong>, because it can be very powerful as a simple and entertaining game for kids, as a profound reflection on the digital domain for the elders, but also as an opportunity to approach the same topic from the perspective of different generations.</li>
	<li>It is <strong>international</strong>, because this whole website and the workshop material <a href="{{ site.translate}}" title="Translate Knitting Our Internet via Codeberg Translate">can be translated</a> in any language!</li>
	<li>It is <strong>critical but welcoming</strong>, because it is very opinionated and strongly positioned politically, but it is also open to critiques, aiming to be a truly safe space even if the participants do not know each other.</li>
	<li>It is <strong><em>truly</em> accessible</strong>. Despite “accessibility” being a widely popular but misused buzzword, since the beginning this workshop was built to be a meaningful experience also for people coming from under-represented minorities or with disabilities. The accessibility of <cite>Knitting Our Internet</cite> is <strong>deeply relational</strong>: only by interacting and through the guidance of the host the experience can be inclusive and safe for all.</li>
</ul>

<h3>🎨 Visual identity</h3>

<p>The look of the workshop follows a visual identity aimed at communicating the <em>vibe</em> of the experience, while having a meaning by itself.</p>

<p>I talked a lot with <a href="https://instagram.com/mariasolefalcomer_/" title="Sole’s Instagram profile">Sole</a>, <a href="https://rahak.net" title="Karthik’s personal website">Karthik</a>, and <a href="https://instagram.com/veronicawithc/" title="Veronica’s Instagram profile">Veronica</a> about how to represent <strong>coziness</strong> and cuteness in a very nerd, techy, and pixelated way, and I came up with this. Learn more by reading the visual identity guidelines below.</p>

<h3>🖌️ Make art</h3>

<p>Our mission is not merely to take back control of Our Internet. I believe in the strong value of art to convey and amplify a message and a mission.</p>

<h3>📣 Spread the word!</h3>

<p>Make our voices heard and reclaim Our Internet! Share <a href="https://ournet.rocks/">ournet.rocks</a> and join our fight!</p>

<p>It would be particularly meaningful if you knew anyone organizing events or actively participating in communities that would be interested in hosting the workshop. Connect us!</p>

<h2>🤗 Contribution philosophy</h2>

<p>When considering the idea of involving other people and ask for their time and effort, I did not want to do so for the sake of friendship only, but at the same time I do not have the funds to pay their work either.</p>

<p>For these reasons, this whole project is brought forward on the principles of <strong>mutual aid</strong> and <strong>personal curiosity</strong>.</p>
