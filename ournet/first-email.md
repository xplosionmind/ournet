Dear friends,

I am thrilled to be writing you this email as the commencement of a wonderful experimental collective endeavour. This is an introductory message to kick off our work together. All details follow below.

## Who are the people here?

The incredible people in this mailing list:

- **Sole** is an awesome visual artist, currently graduating from the Venice Academy of Fine Arts. She worked with me at [Scambi Festival] in 2023, after we met at an open transfeminism assembly in Venice.
- **Karthik** is a designer, currently attending a [Master of Arts in Graphic Design] at the Estonian Academy of Arts. We met in Berlin a few months ago, we lived together for a couple of months, and we immediately realized we share a lot of interests.
- **Veronica** is a designer too, and I am proud to say she is my tattoo artist. We met in Berlin too, through Dario. Even though Vero never advertised it, I explored her work and I believe it is astounding and marvellous.
- **[Wing]** is a designer I met online, thanks to our shared interest in the IndieWeb. She created the indieweb.guide website, and, as soon as I saw it, I realized she would be a great addition to this team.

Dario and Sabrina are my best friends, and they are reading in Cc not only because I always value their precious feedback, but also because they are the only two people here who actually attended the workshop.

## What is this all about?

At this time in 2023 I was concluding [my bachelor thesis], titled ‚ÄúComputer Sciences Are Social Sciences‚Äù. Driven also by the need to find a simple and effective way to explain what the [Fediverse] is and the way it works, I conceived [a workshop] to explore its core principles. I hosted it around a dozen times in the past year, in many different occasions, in diverse environments, with all kinds of people (an overview [here]).

The workshop improved and matured bit by bit every time I hosted it, and I got surprising overwhelming positive feedback after each session. This enthusiasm made me want to structure it a bit better, and promote it properly‚Äîso far, I offered to host it spontaneously, without advertising it at all.

Hence, I‚Äôd like to involve you in the following missions:
- finding and developing a graphical identity for the workshop
- designing a dedicated website
- creating promo flyers, posters, and stickers
- anything else that we feel it would be nice to tackle

### Title

The title of the workshop works best in Italian: ‚ÄúLa Nostra Rete‚Äù (literally, ‚ÄúOur Net‚Äù), but the English title I‚Äôd use is ‚ÄúKnitting Our Internet‚Äù, so that there is a more explanatory label, with a cosy vibe. I will properly explain my ideas when we chat all together.

Full disclosure: ideally, my intention is to publish a little novel with the same title of the workshop‚Ä¶ but we‚Äôll see‚Ä¶

## How

The aspect that excites me the most about our experiment is the method I am proposing to adopt: **MUTUAL HELP** (there might be a more appropriate and better sounding name for this). The core philosophy is that you help me with this, and in exchange I help you with something else.

There are some great perks:
- We all probably don‚Äôt have the funds to properly finance the people working on the projects in question. Therefore, by helping each other we use our time and our work as **the currency** for the time and commitment we invest.
- The projects are not merely individual any more, but they are the result of a collective effort.
- the fundamental spirit driving this work is **friendship**, so everyone can freely choose to work on the aspect they are interested in the most, also by determining autonomously how much they are willing to take on.
- Lastly, we can use the work done for someone else‚Äôs project to enrich our own portfolios. This not only helps us individually, but it can be a great way to promote each others‚Äô work.

A couple of clarifications:
- you are totally free to commit as much as you like, as long as you complete the tasks you committed to.
- I don‚Äôt mean that the current group has to exchange help only among the people who are part of it right now, but this works without any ‚Äúmembership‚Äù bounds.

## When

I intend to keep the timeline light and chill. Sole is graduating at the end of June, so I propose to start our work in July.

Unfortunately, there are a couple of festivals that have a submission deadline at the end of June. I would love to propose the workshop, so it would be great and super useful if we can start a discussion before then.

What about a 1h intro videocall next week? Please, fill out [this form](https://framadate.org/iocSP5C5KhZYljjm) to find the right time (NOTE: dates and times are CEST).

(Wing: I created [a Signal group](https://signal.group/#CjQKIJIMyJkJhqj-KyS0obziBYs2s2kPJ42-mcbnWRqtRoVMEhAjlbUPPW5dGvSE7GzThNAo), you‚Äôre welcome to join)

Thanks a lot for your interest and for your time! We‚Äôll do awesome things together! ‚ù§Ô∏èüöÄ

Best,
Tommi
