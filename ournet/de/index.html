<h2>🧐 About</h2>

<h3>The story</h3>

<p>During the first semester of 2023, while writing <a href="https://tommi.space/csss/" title="“Computer Sciences Are Social Sciences”, Tommaso Marmo’s bachelor’s thesis">his bachelor’s thesis</a>, <a href="https://tommi.space/" title="The virtual representation of Tommi’s mind">Tommi</a>, got an idea for a simple yet critical and accurate introduction the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse" title="Fediverse on Wikipedia">Fediverse</a> to non-experts. Enriched by the research for his thesis, the content and structure of the workshop changed and matured over time, adapting to very diverse publics of any age and background.</p>

<p>In June 2024, after <a href="/#events" title="Past and future occasions when this workshop was and will be hosted">having hosted the workshop in many occasions</a> Tommi decided to deepen his work on <cite>Knitting Our Internet</cite>, also involving <a href="#contributors">some friends</a> to give it a visual identity, a better structure, and publish its website—the one you are reading right now.</p>

<h3>🫱🏼‍🫲🏾 For all! 💕</h3>

<p>It is not merely rhethorical: this workshop is truly <strong>for everyone</strong>! This workshop was <a href="/knit/#modularity">concieved to adapt</a> to any public and environment, by design.</p>

<ul>
	<li>It is <strong>inter-generational</strong>, because it can be very powerful as a simple and entertaining game for kids, as a profound reflection on the digital domain for the elders, but also as an opportunity to approach the same topic from the perspective of different generations.</li>
	<li>It is <strong>international</strong>, because this whole website and the workshop material <a href="{{ site.translate}}" title="Translate Knitting Our Internet via Codeberg Translate">can be translated</a> in any language!</li>
	<li>It is <strong>critical but welcoming</strong>, because it is very opinionated and strongly positioned politically, but it is also open to critiques, aiming to be a truly safe space even if the participants do not know each other.</li>
	<li>It is <strong><em>truly</em> accessible</strong>. Despite “accessibility” being a widely popular but misused buzzword, since the beginning this workshop was built to be a meaningful experience also for people coming from under-represented minorities or with disabilities. The accessibility of <cite>Knitting Our Internet</cite> is <strong>deeply relational</strong>: only by interacting and through the guidance of the host the experience can be inclusive and safe for all.</li>
