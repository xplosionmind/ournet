## About

### History

This workshop was conceived in June 2023 by [Tommi](https://tommi.space 'The virtual representation of Tommi’s mind'), who was looking for a simple yet critical and accurate way to introduce the concept of the [Fediverse] to non-experts. The content and structure of the workshop changed and matured over time, adapting to very diverse publics of any ages and backgrounds, at times including Tommi’s research for <cite>Computer Sciences are Social Sciences</cite>, his bachelor’s thesis.

In June 2024, after [having hosted the workshop in many occasions], Tommi decided to take <cite>🪡 Knitting Our Internet 🧶</cite> to the next level, involving a [marvelous team of incredible people](#the-team) to give it a visual identity, a better structure, and publish its website—the one you are reading right now.

### In a few words

<cite>🪡 Knitting Our Internet 🧶</cite> is an interactive workshop travelling through the history of the Internet, and a collective re-imagining of participatory, decentralised alternatives.

This workshop aims at questioning the very essence of today’s social networks, exposing the critical limits given by centralization, monopoly, and surveillance capitalism.

## Domain name

I have been thinking *a lot* on the domain name for this website: [sooo many ideas](https://github.com/xplosionmind/ournet/issues/8 '🤔 Are we sure about the domain name? – issue #8 in xplosionmind/ournet on GitHub'), [too many possibilities](https://shop.gandi.net/en/domain/suggest?search=ourinternet 'Search “ourinternet” in Gandi Shop')—all quite costly. Not one convinced me fully, therefore I went with a nice one that was cheap enough. `ourinternet.in` highlights that we are *in* our Internet, and that we build it together, from the *inside*, by participating, being proactive, and involved.

## Method

This workshop started as a personal project, but it evolved into a broader and more structured endeavour, involving [many wonderful people](#team). When considering the idea of involving other individuals and ask for their time and efforts, Tommi did not want to do so for the sake of friendship only, but he did not have the funds to pay their work either. This is why this whole project is brought forward on the principles of **personal curiosity** and **mutual aid**.
