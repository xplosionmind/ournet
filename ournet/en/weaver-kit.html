<p>The workshop is <strong>flexible</strong> and <strong>continuously changing</strong> <em>by design</em> because <u>it’s modular</u>!</p>

<p>I chose this structure to <u>adapt</u> the workshop to <a href='/#for-all'>the most diverse publics</a> and <a href='/#events'>situations</a>. As doing all the modules would probably result in a long, overwhelming, and confusing workshop, choose (and rearrange) the modules based on who is participating and the topics you want to focus on.</p>

<article id='centralized' class='core | module'>
	<h3>🎯 Simulate a centralized network</h3>
	<p><u>How do current mainstream centralized social media <em>actually work</em></u>? This little game transforms the group of participants in a small, simplified centralized network, providing a tangible understanding of what it is and how it behaves.</p>
	<h4 id='centralized-network'>Constituting the network</h4>
	<p>The participants stand (or sit) in a circumference. A person (usually the host) stands in the centre, impersonating the social media “platform”. In their hands, they hold the <strong>yarn</strong> that will be used to establish connections.</p>
	<p>The host asks: <q>Who wants to join this new, super cool, super trendy, super popular social network?</q> For the sake of the simulation, let’s assume that many participants want to join.</p>
	<p>Every person who signs up to the centralized social network will be handed out a portion of the string from the yarn, but always going back to the person in the middle, so that the only connection among the “members” of the social network is through the centre.</p>
	<figure>
		{% render 'svg/centralized.svg' %}
	</figure>
	<h4 id='centralized-simulation'>The limits of centralization</h4>
	<p>To expose the intrinsic problems of centralized networks, enact some common operations that happen on social media. The key of this simulation is to <u>highlight the incredible power held by whoever is in the middle</u>, that is the centralized entity <u>mediating all the exchanges</u> happening within the network. To do so, behave “well” at first, then exploit your power by distorting or creating messages:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Publishing</strong> something: one of the participants tells what they want to share in the ear of the host, or they write it on a little piece of paper.
			<ol>
				<li>Regular behavior: the host shares the content of the post with everyone, out loud.</li>
				<li id='shadow-ban'><em lang='en'><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_ban'>Shadow ban</a></em>: for whatever reason, the host decides not to share the post with some users, demonstrating how they can arbitrarily hide troublesome content from as many timelines as they like.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li id='dm'><strong>Direct message</strong>: by being the only “messenger” between one user and another, the centralized entity can distort messages.</li>
		<li id='ads'><strong>Advertisements</strong>: the centralized entity can <em>produce</em> content itself, if someone pays money to share it with the network. Any content can be shared as an advertisement, and there is no reliable way to know how many people see an ad, and how many ads one person sees.</li>
		<li id='censorship'><strong>Censorship</strong>: the centralized network has the power of cutting the connection (in this simulation, cutting the string) with any member, leaving them completely isolated.</li>

	<h3>🍃 Environmental impact</h3>
	<p>An effective way to tangibly represent the environmental impact of centralized networks as opposed to decentralized ones is to play with the concept of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability#Horizontal_(scale_out)_and_vertical_scaling_(scale_up)'>vertical and horizontal scaling</a>.</p>
	<p>Use some kind of weight, for example a book, to physically represent the amount of storage and (computational) resources every user requires to be connected.</p>
	<h4 id='environment-centralized'>The environmental impact of a centralized network</h4>
	<p>Therefore, for every new user signing up on the centralized network, a new weight/book is added in the arms of the person acting as the server, demonstrating how resource-intensive it is to have a computer connected to the internet running 24/7 for hundreds of millions of people.</p>

	<h4 id='environment-decentralized'>The environmental impact of a decentralized network</h4>
	<p>What changes in a decentralized network? Do this at the end of the <a href='#decentralization'>decentralization module</a>.</p>
	<p>The load for every new user does not weight on one single point, that is the centralized server, but it <u>spreads across the network</u>. Symbolically, the weight/book for every new user is held by the new users themselves.</p>

	<h4 id='baran'>Paul Baran’s <q>centrifugal</q> network</h4>
	<p>The Internet was born out of the strategic military endeavors of the US, stimulated by the Cold War. <a href='https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/document/28620-document-12-1963-report-net-evaluation-subcommittee-national-security-council-oral' title='1963 Report of the Net Evaluation Subcommittee, National Security Council Oral Presentation, 27 August 1963, Top Secret, excised copy'>The security of the national communication infrastructure</a> was among the country’s most pressing concerns. In particular, the primary worry was the lack of coordination capabilities to launch a counterattack after a potential first strike by the USSR.</p>

			<figcaption class='no-print'>Baran’s sketch of a centralized network.</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</div>

	<p>This problem was studied by a team of engineers of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAND_Corporation' title='RAND Corporation on Wikipedia'>RAND Corporation</a>, including <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Baran' title='Paul Baran on Wikipedia'>Paul Baran</a>.</p>

	<p>This challenge brought him to conceive a game-changing communication system based on the fragmentation and decentralization of packages of information, to prevent having a single point of failure. In his <cite><a href='https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/H/bo10546731.html'>A History of the Internet and the Digital Future</a></cite>, Johnny Ryan highlights the essential principles of Baran’s idea:</p>

	<div class='scroll-sheet'>
		<figure>
			<blockquote><p>Baran’s concept had the same <strong>centrifugal</strong> character that defines the Internet today. At its most basic, … the “centrifugal” approach is <u>to flatten established hierarchies and put power and responsibility at the nodal level</u> so that each node is equal. Baran’s network focused on what he called <q><u>user to user rather than … centre-to-centre operation</u></q>.</p></blockquote>
			<figcaption>Johnny Ryan – <cite><a href='https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/H/bo10546731.html'>A History of the Internet and the Digital Future</a></cite>.</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</div>

	<p>What was revolutionary was indeed the counter-intuitive effort to disperse and split up information rather than consolidating and securing it within one single communication channel. Therefore, instead of focusing on making the existing system as fail-proof as possible by attempting to physically and theoretically secure a few core and indispensable communication centers, <a href='https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_memoranda/RM2632.html' title='On a Distributed Command and Control System Configuration'>Baran put in question that very structure, and turned it upside down</a>.</p>

			<figcaption class='no-print'>Baran’s sketch of a distributed network.</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</div>

	<p>It does not come as a surprise to know that his idea was so brilliant and courageous to be considered too risky. Baran’s invention was projected to cost 60 million dollars in order to be implemented in 1964, on the opposite, the existing centralized and radio-based communication system was costing 2 billion per year. Despite the blatant economical advantages and the immense technological potential of this system, AT&amp;T, the major US communication company in the US at the time, <a href='https://ethw.org/Oral-History:Paul_Baran'>refused to invest in the project</a>. Such reluctance is not limited to the embryonic internet of the early 70s, but it is rather a common trait of the initial history of the Internet, up until the early 90s.</p>

	<h4 id='licklider'>Licklider and ARPA</h4>

	<p>The main reason of such diffused skepticism could be easily traced back to the subversive and literally revolutionary vision the early Internet brought forward. In a century torn by global wars, astonishing and unsettling discoveries, the last thing politics and the market wanted was to start questioning one of the most essential and reliable tools people could count on: the communication system.</p>

	<p>Still, once it entered the play field of technological advancement, the Internet showed a potential too great to be dismissed for good. Even before Baran’s theory, <a href='https://doi.org/10.1080/24701475.2018.1560680' title='Back to the roots of ARPANET and Internet history with Alexandre Serres'>already in February 1958</a> the <abbr title='Advanced Research Projects Agency'>ARPA</abbr> (predecessor of the current widely known <abbr title='Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency'>DARPA</abbr>) was born. One of its most prominent figures was the psychologist and computer scientist <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider' title='Licklider on Wikipedia'>Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider</a>, who soon became one of the protagonists of the history of the Internet.</p>

		</figure>
	</div>

	<p>For him too, Ryan frames perfectly his visionary and ambitious plan:</p>

	<div class='scroll-sheet'>
		<figure>
			<blockquote><p>At the core of Licklider’s thinking was <u>an emphasis on collaboration</u>. Licklider posited a future scenario in which a researcher at one research centre could find a useful computer resource over the network from a research centre elsewhere. This, in a world of incompatible machines and jealously guarded computing resources, was far-sighted talk indeed.</p></blockquote>

		</figure>
	</div>

	<p>As the Internet was kicking off, breeding Licklider’s ambition was not an elitist ensemble of highly trained engineers or capable government contractors, but rather a quite rambling and undefined bunch of Computer Sciences undergraduates from several US universities.</p>

	<h4 id='web'>Tim Berners-Lee and the World Wide Web</h4>

	<p>In 1990, CERN researcher Tim Berners-Lee created the Web. His work started from defining HTML, literally the <q>HyperText Markup Language</q>, a formal language that allowed to insert hyperlinks inside any text. Sir Berners-Lee’s fundamental purpose was to create connections outside the mere content explicitly written in a text by linking keywords to other sources, hence creating a potentially infinite network of resources connected to each other.</p>

	</div>

	<p>Nowadays, the concept of <q>link</q> is so diffused we take it from granted. Nevertheless during the last decade of the XIX century it was a curious novelty casting a completely new perspective, and arguably even a new mentality paradigma. Hence, during its first few years, HTML adoption was so deluding that for a long time the only document written in HTML was CERN’s telephone directory. Slowly but steadily, thanks to great commitment and sacrifices by Berners-Lee, the Web community grew to be world wide</p>

	<p>In 1994 the early developers of the World Wide Web met for a <q>www wizards’ workshop</q>. Berners-Lee proposed the idea of a consortium to oversee the future direction of the Web. The www Consortium, known as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C' title='W3C on Wikipedia'>W3C</a>, was formed to promote interoperability and standardization of web technologies.</p>

	<h3>💩 Surveillance Capitalism</h3>
	<p>At the dawn of the second millennium, the world was experiencing an almost unprecedented technological revolution. Guiding this crusade aimed at claiming control over the future of humanity—thanks to the wonders of the Internet—were a sweeping amount of newborn companies, mainly US-based. The thrill born out of an astounding and appealing opportunity of profit drove virtually everyone to bet on this game-changing technology, which was turning out to be <q>the big next thing</q>. Fouled by the incredible innovations technological research gave birth to, investors went all-in to support this trend, which exploded in what has been labeled as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble' title='Dot-com bubble on Wikipedia'>the Dot-com bubble</a>.</p>

	<p>As history repeats itself, the run for investments at the beginning of the Internet essentially has no difference with the run for gold of the Wild West, the early speculation on oil extraction between the XIX and the XX century, or the cryptocurrencies and <q>Web3</q> mania: intercepting the faintest opportunity for profit, an economically-driven society such as the current global one makes its best effort to explore and exploit it. I believe that, since its original sin, the Internet showed to be one of such opportunities and, possibly, the greatest—hence, the worst.</p>

	<p>Surveillance capitalism seems inescapable as much as it is troubling. How can we fight it? How do we restore the open and friendly spirit of the early Internet, while still enjoying the fun and resourcefulness of contemporary social networks?</p>
	<p>At this point of our journey, we got that the very essence of the technical infrasctructure on which we base our digital communications has a fundamental sociological, political, and economical relevance.</p>
	<p>Let’s envision a network where <strong><em>we</em> hold the power</strong>…</p>
	<h4>…let’s knit <em>Our</em> Internet!</h4>
	<p>Using the same yarn you used for <a href='#centralized-network'>the centralized network simulation</a>, start connecting the participants of the network, one by one, directly. Connect people at the opposites of the circumference, so that the resulting decentralized network is more scenic.</p>
	<p>The final network will be showing the essential structure of the <em>true</em> Internet, a network that is built <em>by</em> ourselves, <em>for</em> ourselves.</p>

	<h3>💕 Conclusion</h3>
	<p>Actually, the images of the centralized and decentralized networks are cropped from an illustration that Paul Baran himself sketched <strong>in 1964</strong>!</p>

	<p>Since 60 years ago we have the blueprint for the creation of decentralized and open networks. Technically, we have all the tools we need to make this technology the standard, but we saw that power dynamics and greed hindered such development. The steps forward to be taken are first of all <strong>political</strong>!</p>

	<h4>The Internet is <em>ours</em>!</h4>
	<p>Go back to what was written on the poster/whiteboard <a href='#intro'>at the beginning</a> of the workshop.</p>
	<p>If we control <em>Our</em> Internet, together we can reimagine social networks that focus on the pros, and commit to limit or even to eliminate the cons.</p>

	<h3>⁂ The Fediverse</h3>
	<div class='green box'>
		The concept of a federated network of social media instances is a topic so big and complex that is would deserve a whole workshop just by itself. This module, more than any other, requires the host to be familiar with what the Fediverse is, the main challenges concerning it, and the relational dynamics occurring there. Below there are just some little examples that can be brought up, but I discourage you to put too much on the table: do not confuse the participants by explaining them so many things in one session!
	</div>
	<p>Here are a few possible activities in relation to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse' title='Fediverse on Wikipedia'>Fediverse</a>.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Show, don’t tell!</strong> Fire up a device and browse the Fediverse. Explain the basics (user handles, instances, boosts, comments…), then let the participants’ pose their questions and, step by step, dive deeper following the flow.</li>
		<li><strong>What are the principles of our ideal online community?</strong> With the help of the board filled during the introduction, make people write the code of conduct of their ideal Fediverse instance. Compare it with existing ones.</li>
		<li><strong>Managing relationships among users and among instances</strong>. Potentially using the yarn again, create subgroups of people and connect everyone as in Baran’s illustration of a decentralized network (B).
			<ul>
				<li>Blocking another instance or another user</li>
				<li>Migrating to another instance</li>
				<li>Closing an instance</li>
				<li>Moderating a post</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Alt-texts and content warnings</li>
	</ul>
