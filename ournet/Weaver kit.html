<p>If you are interested in hosting this workshop, you are in the right place!</p>

<p>Here is all you need to guide a group of people into the depths of the Internet, namely, to be a <strong><em>weaver</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Consider all the following information and materials as <em>best practices</em>: <a href='/#events'>they worked well in the past</a>, and they are very opinionated. Nevertheless, you are completely <u>free to change anything</u> as you wish—as long as you respect the <a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0' title='Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License'>CC-BY-SA licence</a>. If you have any questions, critiques, ideas or suggestions, you are more than welcome to <a href='/#contribute'>contribute</a>, so that we can make this workshop better, together!</p>

<p>If you are lost, you have some suggestions, or you would just like to say <q>hi</q>, please do <a href='mailto:surfing@tommi.space'>get in touch</a>!</p>

<h2 id='modularity'>Modularity</h2>

<p>The workshop is <strong>flexible</strong> and <strong>continuously changing</strong> <em>by design</em> because <u>it’s modular</u>!</p>

<p>Tommi chose this structure to <u>adapt</u> the workshop to <a href='/#inter-generational'>the most diverse publics</a> and <a href='/events/'>situations</a>. As doing all modules would probably result in a long, overwhelming, and confusing workshop, choose (and move) the modules according to the people involved and the topics you want to focus on.</p>

<h3 id='themes'>Themes</h3>

<p>Modules are colour-labelled according to their general theme.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong><mark class='core'>Core</mark></strong>: the very essence of this workshop.</li>
	<li><strong><mark class='main'>Main</mark></strong>: modules that are a nice complement to the core module.</li>
	<li><strong><mark class='history'>History</mark></strong>: distributing <cite><a href='#scroll'>The Internet’s Scroll</a></cite> to all the participants, you can narrate the history of the Internet interactively. For every step of the Internet’s story, you can involve a participant to show/read a page of the Scroll.</li>

<details id='intro' class='main'>
	<summary><h3>👋🏼 Introduction</h3></summary>
	<p>To kick off the workshop, the host and the participants <strong>introduce themselves</strong>, maybe using some icebreakers to warm up the environment and create a friendly mood.</p>
</details>

<details id='board-a' class='main'>
	<summary><h3>🤔 Discussion</h3>&emsp;How do we feel about mainstream social media?</summary>
	<p>Gather everyone’s thoughts and feelings about the current state of mainstream and centralized social media.</p>
	<p>Split a <strong>whiteboard</strong>/poster in two parts: write <strong>positive</strong> comments on one side, and <strong>negative</strong> ones on the other.</p>
	<p>If needed, the following questions can be helpful to start the debate:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>How do you feel about current social media?</li>
		<li>What are their effects on your daily life?</li>
		<li>How do you believe they influence society?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Any arguments are valid! Be them personal or political, facts or impressions, doubts or certainties, take note of the keywords of every point raised.</p>
	<p>After some minutes, wrap up the discussion, and set the board aside. <a href='#board-b'>We will get back to it during the conclusion</a>.</p>

	<summary><h3>🎯 Simulate a centralized network</h3></summary>
	<p>How does current mainstream centralized social media <em>actually work</em>? This little game transforms the group of participants in a small, simplified centralized network, providing a tangible understanding of what it is and how it behaves.</p>
	<h4 id='centralized-network'>Constituting the network</h4>
	<p>The participants stand (or sit) in a circumference. A person (usually the host) stands in the centre, impersonating the social media “platform”. In their hands, they hold the <strong>yarn</strong> that will be used to establish connections.</p>
	<p>The host asks: <q>Who wants to join this new, super cool, super trendy, super popular social network?</q> For the sake of the simulation, let’s assume that many participants want to join.</p>
	<p>Every person who signs up to the centralized social network will be handed out a portion of the string from the yarn, but always going back to the person in the middle, so that the only connection among the “members” of the social network is through the centre.</p>
	<h4 id='centralized-simulation'>The limits of centralization</h4>
	<p>To expose the intrinsic problems of centralized networks, enact some common operations that happen on social media. The key of this simulation is to <u>highlight the incredible power held by whoever is in the middle</u>, that is the centralized entity <u>mediating all the exchanges</u> happening within the network. To do so, behave “well” at first, then exploit the power of being the key node of any exchange by distorting or creating messages:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>publishing</strong> something: one of the participants tells what they want to share in the ear of the host, or they write it on a little piece of paper.
			<ol>
				<li>Regular behavior: the host shares the content of the post with everyone, out loud.</li>
				<li id='shadow-ban'><em lang='en'><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_ban'>Shadow ban</a></em>: for whatever reason, the host decides not to share the post with some users, demonstrating how they can arbitrarily hide troublesome content from as many timelines as they like.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li id='dm'><strong>Direct message</strong>: by being the only “messenger” between one user and another, the centralized entity can distort messages.</li>
		<li id='ads'><strong>Advertisements</strong>: the centralized entity can <em>produce</em> content itself, if someone pays money to share it with the network. Any content can be shared as an advertisement, and there is no reliable way to know how many people see an ad, and how many ads one person sees.</li>
		<li id='censorship'><strong>Censorship</strong>: the centralized network has the power of cutting the connection (in this simulation, cutting the string) with any member, leaving them completely isolated.</li>
		<li><a href='#environment'>Environmental impact</a></li>
	</ol>

<details id='environment' class='environment'>
	<summary><h3>🍃 Environmental impact</h3></summary>
	<p>An effective way to tangibly represent the environmental impact of centralized networks as opposed to decentralized ones is to play with the concept of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability#Horizontal_(scale_out)_and_vertical_scaling_(scale_up)'>vertical and horizontal scaling</a>.</p>
	<p>Let’s use some kind of weight, for example a book, to physically represent the amount of storage and (computational) resources every user requires to be connected.</p>
	<h4 id='environment-centralized'>The environmental impact of a centralized network</h4>
	<p>Therefore, for every new user signing up on the centralized network, a new weight/book is added in the arms of the person acting as the server, demonstrating how resource-intensive it is to have a computer connected to the internet running 24/7 for hundreds of millions of people.</p>
	<h4 id='environment-decentralized'>The environmental impact of a decentralized network</h4>
	<p>What changes in a decentralized network? Do this at the end of the <a href='#decentralization'>decentralization module</a>.</p>
	<p>The load for every new user does not weight on one single point, that is the centralized server, but it <u>spreads across the network</u>. Symbolically, the weight/book for every new user is held by the new users themselves.</p>

<details id='origins' class='history'>
	<summary><h3>📜 The origins of the Internet</h3></summary>
	<p>The Internet was born out of the strategic military endeavors of the US, stimulated by the Cold War. <a href='https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/document/28620-document-12-1963-report-net-evaluation-subcommittee-national-security-council-oral' title='1963 Report of the Net Evaluation Subcommittee, National Security Council Oral Presentation, 27 August 1963, Top Secret, excised copy'>The security of the national communication infrastructure</a> was among the country’s most pressing concerns. In particular, the primary worry was the lack of coordination capabilities to launch a counterattack after a potential first strike by the USSR. This problem brought the engineer <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Baran' title='Paul Baran on Wikipedia'>Paul Baran</a> to conceive a game-changing communication system based on the fragmentation and decentralization of packages of information, to prevent having a single point of failure. In his <cite><a href='https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/H/bo10546731.html'>A History of the Internet and the Digital Future</a></cite>, Johnny Ryan highlights the essential principles of Baran’s idea:</p>

	<blockquote><p>Baran’s concept had the same <strong>centrifugal</strong> character that defines the Internet today. At its most basic, … the “centrifugal” approach is <u>to flatten established hierarchies and put power and responsibility at the nodal level</u> so that each node is equal. Baran’s network focused on what he called <q><u>user to user rather than … centre-to-centre operation</u></q>.</p></blockquote>

	<summary><h3>⁂ Intro to the Fediverse</h3></summary>
	<p>🏗️ <strong>[WIP]</strong>: If a more accurate and complex representation of the Fediverse is to be enacted, the cardboard notes should be connected as a decentralized network, while small sub-groups of participants are connected in a centralized way to a node of their choice. In this case, further operations in the Fediverse could be enacted.</p>
