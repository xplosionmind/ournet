## Guide

<details class='core' open>
	<summary><h3>Introduction</h3></summary>
	<p>To kick off the workshop, the host and the participants **introduce themselves**, and they warm up with some simple [icebreakers](#TODO: links for options and information)</p>
</details>

<details class='main'>
	<summary><h3>How do we feel about mainstream social media?</h3></summary>
	<p>Use the <strong>whiteboard</strong>/poster to gather everyone‚Äôs thoughts and feelings about the current state of mainstream and centralized social media. Let these questions guide the debate:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>How do you feel about current social media?</li>
		<li>How do you believe they influence society?</li>
		<li>What are their effects on your daily life?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Split the board in two parts, use one for the <strong>positive</strong> comments, and another for the </strong>negative</strong> ones.

	<summary><h3>Centralization and yarn game</h3></summary>
	<p>The host impersonates the centralized social network, distributing a portion of the rope to each person sitting in the circle. They do so while remaining the unique connection among the participants. Each person should hold in their hands a part of the rope, and the host the only mediator at the center of all the connections the rope creates. At this point, the host should ask to a person to secretly tell or write them a controversial statement. The host should share with the rest of the group a distorted version of the message, proving how the centralized node hs complete unconditional control on all the conversations happening in the network.</p>

5. Decentralization and rope game: use the same rope to create a peer-to-peer network, where every user is directly connected to all the others. If a more accurate and complex representation of the Fediverse is to be enacted, the cardboard notes should be connected as a decentralized network, while small sub-groups of participants are connected in a centralized way to a node of their choice. In this case, further operations in the Fediverse could be enacted.
	- Migrating to another instance
	- Defederating another instance
6. As the conclusion, go back to what was written on the poster/whiteboard at the beginning of the workshop, and reason collectively on if and how the pros and cons of centralized social media relate to the Fediverse.
