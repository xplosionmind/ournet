<h1 align='center'>🪡 Knitting Our Internet 🧶</h1>

This repository hosts the resources, the material, and the website’s source code for [*Knitting Our Internet*](https://ournet.rocks/ 'Knitting Our Internet – website'), an interactive workshop travelling through the history of the Internet, and a collective re-imagination of participatory, decentralized alternatives.

This workshop aims at questioning the very essence of today’s social networks, exposing the critical limits given by centralization, monopoly, and surveillance capitalism.

At the moment, we have **no funding** whatsoever: all the expenses we face come our of our pockets. Even though we definitely do not do this for profit ([we hate capitalism](/knit/#surveillance-capitalism 'Section on Surveillance capitalism in The Weaver kit')), it would help a lot if you could chip in with **a donation you can afford**.

### 🧑🏽‍💻 Improve the code

We absolutely are not Web development masters…

#### 🏗️ Site structure

The structure of this repository, displayed below, is particularly complex because it is designed to make the integration with Weblate as smooth as possible.

```
./
├─ archive/
├─ meetings/
├─ ournet/
│	├─ _data/
│	├─ _includes/
│	│	└─ [LANG]/
│	├─ _layouts/
│	├─ artwork/
│	├─ assets/
│	├─ [LANG]/
│	│	├─ [PAGE]
│	│	└─ [PAGE].11tydata.json
│	└─ root.11tydata.json
├─ .eleventy.js
├─ .gitignore
├─ deno.lock
├─ package.json
└─ README.md
```

- `archive`, `meetings`, `ournet/assets`, `ournet/artwork`, and `README.md` are not parsed by Eleventy.
- Eleventy [just copies](https://codeberg.org/tommi/ournet/src/commit/740f0b5e703b7b16df18a0027ca1232bc66338a8/.eleventy.js#L17) `ournet/assets` and  `ournet/artwork` to the output directory.
- `ournet` is considered the [“input” directory](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/#input-directory '“Input Directory” section in 11ty’s Configuration Docs'), where the templates to be generated are placed.
- All the actual website pages are placed in a sub-directory of `ournet` that uses the language’s code (e.g. `ournet/el` for Greek).
- All templates that are to be translated must have [a separate datafile](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-template-dir/ '“Template and Directory Data Files” in 11ty Docs') (always ending in `.11tydata.json`), so that Weblate does not mess up the syntax while merging translations.
- Please, get in touch if you need more specific or advanced clarifications.

#### 🔧 Build steps

To serve or build the website locally, you have to install [Deno](https://deno.land/ 'Deno’s official website'), then, you should be up and running with one simple command:

```
deno install # only the first time, to install dependencies
deno run start
```

Once the local development server has started, you can see the live local preview visiting <http://localhost:8080/>.
