I can host the workshop in Italian, English, and French.

If you want to invite me to host the workshop, do not hesitate to [write me an
email](mailto:surfingtommi.space)! Some general guidelines below.

## 🚅 Spese di viaggio

I cannot afford to travel around self-funded. Whenever I am invited, the only
thing I ask is for my travel expenses to be **fully reimbursed**.

I prefer not to travel by airplane.

## 🪙 Retribuzione

Even though preparing every activity requires quite some time and a bit of
expenses, I usually host the worshop **for free**. Still, it would be immensely
meaningful for me if his work could be valued with some sort of retribution,
especially if the hosting entity is a for-profit.

I dettagli saranno discussi via email e valutati caso per caso.
