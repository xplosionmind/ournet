			<p>Baran‚Äôs concept had the same <strong>centrifugal</strong> character that defines the Internet today. At its most basic, ‚Ä¶ the ‚Äúcentrifugal‚Äù approach is <u>to flatten established hierarchies and put power and responsibility at the nodal level</u> so that each node is equal. Baran‚Äôs network focused on what he called <q><u>user to user rather than ‚Ä¶ centre-to-centre operation</u></q>.</p>

		<blockquote><p>At the core of Licklider‚Äôs thinking was <u>an emphasis on collaboration</u>. Licklider posited a future scenario in which a researcher at one research centre could find a useful computer resource over the network from a research centre elsewhere. This, in a world of incompatible machines and jealously guarded computing resources, was far-sighted talk indeed.</p></blockquote>

NSF‚Äôs own networking activities would be limited to a high-speed research network. By this time, in 1993, the Internet included ten thousand networks. In accordance with the plan, the prohibition on commercial activity on the NSF backbone was rescinded on 1 January 1995.

				<li>A new economic order that claims human experience as free raw material for hidden commercial practices of extraction, prediction, and sales;</li>
				<li>A parasitic economic logic in which the production of goods and services is subordinated to a new global architecture of behavioral modification;</li>
