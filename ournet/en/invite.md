Tommi can host the workshop in Italian, English, and French.

If you want to invite him to host the workshop, do not hesitate to [write him an email](mailto:lost.in@tommi.space)! Some general guidelines below.

## ðŸš… Travel expenses

Tommi is a student, and he cannot afford to travel around self-funded. Whenever he is invited, the only thing he asks is for his travel expenses to be **fully reimbursed**.

He prefers not to travel by airplane.

## ðŸª™ Retribution

Even though preparing every activity requires quite some time and a bit of expenses, Tommi usually hosts the worshop **for free**. Still, it would be immensely meaningful for him if his work could be valued with some sort of retribution, especially if the hosting entity is a for-profit.

Details to be discussed via email, and evaluated case-by-case.
