If you want to invite him, do not hesitate to [write him an email](mailto:lost.in@tommi.space)! Some general guidelines below.

## ðŸš… Travel expenses

Tommi is a student, and he cannot afford to travel around self-funded. The only thing he asks is for his travel expenses to be reimbursed.

He prefers not to travel by airplane.

## ðŸª™ Retribution

Tommi is super happy to host the workshop completely free of charge. If the entity inviting him is a for-profit, though, he asks to be paid for his work. Details to be discussed via email, and evaluated case-by-case.
