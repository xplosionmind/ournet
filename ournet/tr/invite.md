I can host the workshop in Italian, English, and French.

If you want to invite me to host the workshop, do not hesitate to [write me an
email](mailto:surfingtommi.space)! Some general guidelines below.

## ðŸš… Seyahat masraflarÄ±

I cannot afford to travel around self-funded. Whenever I am invited, the only
thing I ask is for my travel expenses to be **fully reimbursed**.

I prefer not to travel by airplane.

## ðŸª™ Ãœcretlendirme

Even though preparing every activity requires quite some time and a bit of
expenses, I usually host the worshop **for free**. Still, it would be immensely
meaningful for me if his work could be valued with some sort of retribution,
especially if the hosting entity is a for-profit.

Detaylar e-posta aracÄ±lÄ±ÄŸÄ±yla gÃ¶rÃ¼ÅŸÃ¼lecek ve durum bazÄ±nda deÄŸerlendirilecektir.

## ðŸ§  Expansions and adaptations

The workshop is made to be modular and adaptable to any public and situation.

In addition to that, **on commission** I can **expand it** with modules and more
detailed studies on one or more requested aspects or topics.

Furthermore, I can happily make it more nuanced and **adapt** it to a more
specific and niche sector (e.g. entreprise, education, storytellingâ€¦)
