This workshop aims to be a collective endeavor, and there are many ways you can contribute to it! Here are some ideas.

- 🤩 [**Hosting the workshop**](/host/ 'Host Knitting Our Internet') is the best thing you could do!
- 🪙 **Donate**: every detail of Knitting Our Internet, from the research to this very website, costed us a lot of work. We did not do it for profit (we hate Capitalism), but we still have to pay bills. It would help us a lot if you could chip in with a donation you can afford. Possible ways to do it (sorted by preference):
	1. [LiberaPay](https://liberapay.com/tommi/ 'Tommi on LiberaPay')
	1. [PayPal](https://paypal.me/xplosionmind '@xplosionmind on PayPal.me')
	1. Cash: [get in touch](mailto:surfing@tommi.space), let’s see what we can do
	1. Monero: `4AXFHU3h1GDGVr5nfnyngmSepfesyUJxCSXNH2JzFeBGbGxzzoMuhSCBDVf3THK1E5VnfLLm2hfgV3YosYd27ZFLMCVNUrP`
- 🗣️ **Translate** the content of this website and the workshop materials to enable non English speakers to participate in and/or host the lab! We plan to [adopt an easy system](https://github.com/xplosionmind/ournet/issues/22 '“Adopting an i18n system” issue on GitHub') to manage translations, but feel free to [reach out](mailto:surfing@tommi.space) if you can’t wait.
- 💡 **Add or improve information**: even though we did a lot of research, there is a lot to learn. If you have any critiquest, ideas, or suggestions, [open an issue](https://github.com/xplosionmind/ournet/issues/new 'New issue for ournet on GitHub') or [write us](mailto:surfing@tommi.space)!
- 🧑🏽‍💻 **Improve the code**: we are not pro coders. Actually, we are terrible at this. If you think you can help us with the workflow or with the technical infrastructure of this website, please do not hesitate to [open a PR](https://codeberg.org/tommi/ournet 'ournet on Codeberg')! The source code is open for you to play with!
- 🎨 **Make art**: our mission is not merely to take back control of Our Internet, and we believe in the strong value of art to convey a message and a mission. You are welcome to contribute in any way you’d like to make us look goooood 😎! You could create stickers, paint posters, improve the CSS of this website, create flyers… you name it.
